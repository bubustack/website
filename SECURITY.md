# Security policy

## Supported versions

We provide security updates for the latest released minor of the operator. Please ensure you are using a supported version to receive security patches. We generally support the latest minor and the immediately previous minor.

Supported Kubernetes versions: we aim to support N-2 of upstream stable releases. For example, when Kubernetes 1.31 is current, we target 1.31, 1.30, 1.29. See the bobrapet repository CI matrix and release notes for exact compatibility.

## Reporting a vulnerability

The BubuStack Team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report an operator/platform vulnerability, please use the GitHub Security Advisory feature in the bobrapet repository:

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide the following information:

- **A clear description** of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability, including any example code, scripts, or configurations.
- **The version(s) of the operator** affected.
- **Your contact information** for us to follow up with you.

3.  **Investigation**: We will investigate the vulnerability and determine its scope and impact. We may contact you for additional information during this phase.
4.  **Fix**: We will develop a patch for the vulnerability.
5.  **Disclosure**: We will create a security advisory, issue a CVE (if applicable), and release a new version with the patch. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
