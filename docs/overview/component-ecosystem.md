# Component Ecosystem Overview

This document summarizes how BubuStack's component ecosystem fits together,
including SDK usage, contracts, packaging/registry patterns, and reliability
semantics. It links to the detailed docs and repo references you'll use day-to-day.

## Who this is for

- Component authors building Engrams and Impulses.
- SDK users wiring triggers, inputs, and outputs.
- Platform operators packaging and distributing components.

## What you'll get

- Where the SDKs live and what they cover.
- The core contracts that define inputs, outputs, and errors.
- How components are packaged and discovered.
- The reliability guarantees you must design around.

---

## Quick start: authoring flow

1. Scaffold a component repo with `bubu component init`.
2. Implement an Engram or Impulse using `bubu-sdk-go`.
3. Define schemas in `EngramTemplate` or `ImpulseTemplate`.
4. Validate with `bubu-sdk-go/testkit` and `bubu-sdk-go/conformance`.
5. Publish to a Git-backed registry with `bubu publish`.

## Repo map (where to look)

- `tractatus/` — Protobuf contracts for gRPC transport.
- `core/` — Shared runtime contracts, templating engine, transport connector runtime.
- `bobrapet/` — CRDs, controllers, webhooks, and the runtime contract docs (`/docs/*`).
- `bubu-sdk-go/` — Go SDK, testkit, and conformance helpers.
- `bobravoz-grpc/` — gRPC bridge for external system integration.
- `bubuilder/` — Web console and REST API server.
- `bubu-registry/` — Git-backed registry and the `bubu` CLI.
- `engrams/` — Engram and Impulse component implementations.

For the full module dependency graph and layering rules, see
`/docs/overview/architecture.md`.

## Component SDKs

The Go SDK is the primary authoring surface for components:

- `bubu-sdk-go/README.md` contains usage patterns, runtime context, and configuration.
- `bubu-sdk-go/testkit/` provides a local harness for testing component behavior.
- `bubu-sdk-go/conformance/` provides contract-oriented test suites for batch and streaming.

Use the SDK to:

- Parse runtime context (story, run, step, transport settings).
- Emit outputs, logs, and structured errors.
- Integrate with streaming transports when enabled.

For a full development guide with interfaces, code examples, testing patterns,
and template definitions, see `/docs/sdk/building-engrams.md`.

## Contracts and schemas

Contracts live in two places:

- **CRD schemas** define the API surface for Stories, Runs, Engrams, and Impulses.
  These are authored in `bobrapet/api/**` and documented in `/docs/api/*`.
- **Runtime contracts** define environment variables, labels, annotations, and
  structured error payloads for SDKs. See `core/contracts` and `/docs/api/errors.md`.

Streaming components also follow the streaming message contract:

- `/docs/streaming/streaming-contract.md`
- `/docs/streaming/transport-settings.md`

---

## Packaging and registry patterns

BubuStack's registry uses Git-indexed metadata with versioned package manifests.
You can see examples in:

- `bubu-registry/examples/registry/namespaces/bubustack/index.yaml`
- `bubu-registry/examples/registry/namespaces/bubustack/packages/*/*.yaml`

Registry records capture package identity, versions, and metadata used by
operators and tooling to discover and resolve components.

The `bubu` CLI provides the scaffolding and publish workflow:

- `bubu component init` — create a starter repo with SDK wiring and templates.
- `bubu publish` — add or update a versioned template in a registry repo.

---

## Reliability semantics

Reliability guarantees are defined in `/docs/overview/durable-semantics.md`.
Key themes:

- StoryRun and StepRun creation are idempotent when deterministic IDs are used.
- Step execution is at-least-once; components must handle retries.
- Redrive and rerun behavior is driven by annotations and controller logic.

When designing components, assume retries, partial failure, and replays.
Use idempotency keys and structured errors to preserve correctness.
