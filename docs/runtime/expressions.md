# Template Expressions

This document defines where template expressions are evaluated, which context
variables are allowed, and how determinism is enforced across phases.

## Who this is for

- Workflow authors writing `{{ ... }}` expressions.
- Component authors consuming evaluated inputs.

## What you'll get

- The supported expression syntax and contexts.
- Determinism rules for batch vs streaming.
- Common patterns and pitfalls.

## Quick start

- Always wrap expressions in `{{ ... }}`. Plain strings are treated as literals.
- Use `inputs.*`, `steps.*`, and `packet.*` (streaming only) as your root contexts.
- For step names with dashes, use `steps['my-step']` or `index steps "my-step"`.

## Expression Forms

There are two supported forms:

1. Template strings (Go templates + Sprig):

```json
{
  "path": "{{ inputs.filePath }}",
  "flag": "{{ eq steps.validate.output.ok true }}"
}
```

2. Raw template expressions (for explicit execution by an Engram / SDK):

```json
{
  "$bubuTemplate": "steps.fetch.output.status | int | gt 200",
  "$bubuTemplateVars": {
    "threshold": 200
  }
}
```

Notes:
- Pipes are supported (`|`) via Go templates + Sprig.
- Both `{{ inputs.foo }}` and `{{ .inputs.foo }}` are accepted.
- `$bubuTemplateVars` (optional) merges into the evaluation context for that one expression.

## Template Engine

All templating uses Go `text/template` with the Sprig function library. This means:

- Pipes work as in Sprig/Go templates.
- Missing keys are errors (`missingkey=error`).
- Root names are normalized, so `inputs.foo` and `.inputs.foo` are accepted.
- Plain strings are not evaluated; use `{{ ... }}` to execute expressions.
- For step names with dashes, use `steps['name']` in simple path templates or
  `index steps "name"` in complex expressions.

Sprig functions are available with a few restrictions:

- Disabled for safety: `env`, `expandenv`, `getHostByName`.
- Random helpers and `now` are allowed only in runtime evaluation, not in
  deterministic inputs-only evaluation (see Determinism).

## Custom Helper Functions

Custom helpers are always available in addition to Sprig:

- `len` → Length of strings, arrays, slices, or maps. If the value is an offloaded storage ref,
  evaluation is blocked for materialization.
- `hash_of` → SHA256 of a string or byte array. Offloaded refs are blocked for materialization.
- `type_of` → Returns `string|number|bool|object|array|null`, or `offloaded(<ref>)` for storage refs.
- `exists` → `true` if a value is non-nil.
- `sample` → Returns the value (useful for probing); offloaded refs are blocked for materialization.

## Context Variables

- `inputs.*`: Story input payload (from StoryRun spec.inputs).
- `steps.*`: Step outputs (batch) or upstream packet outputs (streaming hub). In
  streaming, the hub flattens outputs so `steps.my-step` is the output object
  (no `.outputs` wrapper).
- `packet.*`: Per-packet metadata (streaming only).
- `now`: Current timestamp (runtime only; disallowed in deterministic inputs-only evaluation).
- `rand*`, `uuidv4`: Random helpers (runtime only; disallowed in deterministic inputs-only evaluation).

Unsupported aliases (rejected by validation):
- `trigger.*` -> use `inputs.*`
- `upstream.*` -> use `steps.*`

## Evaluation Matrix

### Batch stories (`spec.pattern: batch`)

| Field | When evaluated | Allowed contexts |
|---|---|---|
| `steps[*].if` | runtime (DAG controller) | `inputs`, `steps`, `now`, random helpers |
| `steps[*].with` | runtime (StepRun creation) | `inputs`, `steps`, `now`, random helpers |
| `spec.output` | runtime (StoryRun finalize) | `inputs`, `steps`, `now`, random helpers |
| `steps[*].runtime` | not supported | - |

### Streaming stories (`spec.pattern: streaming`)

| Field | When evaluated | Allowed contexts |
|---|---|---|
| `steps[*].with` | runtime (hub per-packet; deterministic inputs only) | `inputs` |
| `steps[*].runtime` | runtime (hub per-packet) | `inputs`, `steps`, `packet`, `now`, random helpers |
| `steps[*].if` | runtime (hub per-packet) | `inputs`, `steps`, `packet`, `now`, random helpers |
| `spec.output` | runtime (StoryRun finalize, if applicable) | `inputs`, `steps`, `now`, random helpers |

## Common patterns

### Step `if`

```yaml
if: "{{ gt (len steps['fetch'].output.items) 0 }}"
```

### Wait `until`

```yaml
with:
  until: "{{ inputs.ready }}"
```

### Streaming runtime config

```yaml
runtime:
  threshold: "{{ steps.transcribe.confidence }}"
```

## Determinism Rules

Deterministic evaluation forbids `now` and random helpers to keep results replayable.
This applies to inputs-only contexts (for example streaming `steps[*].with`). Runtime
evaluation can use `now`/random helpers as needed.

Template values are resolved at evaluation time and stored in the resulting
StepRun/packet; they remain stable across reconciliation once computed.

## Offloaded data and materialization

Templates may reference step outputs that are offloaded to storage (objects that contain
`$bubuStorageRef`). Direct evaluation of those values is blocked by default.

Behavior is controlled by `templating.offloaded-data-policy`:
- `error` (default): reject evaluation with a clear error.
- `inject`: create a "materialize" StepRun/engram to hydrate data and re‑evaluate the template,
  then continue execution when the result is ready.

When `inject` is enabled, the operator uses `templating.materialize-engram` (commonly set to
`materialize`) to resolve the template in the same StoryRun namespace.

## Templating Configuration

Operator-level limits and behavior are controlled by:

- `templating.evaluation-timeout` (example: `30s`)
- `templating.max-expression-length` (example: `1000`)
- `templating.max-output-bytes` (example: `65536`)
- `templating.deterministic` (`true|false`)
- `templating.offloaded-data-policy` (`error|inject`)
- `templating.materialize-engram` (engram name)

## Validation

The Story webhook enforces the matrix above at admission time. Invalid templates are rejected with
clear field-level errors.
