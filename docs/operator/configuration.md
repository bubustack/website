# Operator Configuration

BubuStack controllers read operator configuration from a ConfigMap. The default
installation wires the ConfigMap referenced by the `--config-namespace` and
`--config-name` flags, and the sample values live in
`config/manager/operator-config.yaml`.

## Who this is for

- Platform engineers operating the BubuStack controller.
- Anyone tuning scheduling, limits, or defaults cluster-wide.

## What you'll get

- Where configuration lives and how it is loaded.
- The precedence rules for overrides.
- A complete list of supported config keys and defaults.

Only the keys listed here are consumed by the controller. Unknown keys are
ignored.

---

## Precedence

Manager flags and environment variables are process-level settings. They are
not sourced from the ConfigMap and are not overridden by it.

1. StepRun overrides (when supported for a setting).
2. Story policy overrides (`spec.policy`).
3. Operator ConfigMap defaults.

---

## Defaults When The ConfigMap Is Missing

If the operator ConfigMap does not exist at startup, the controller continues
with built-in defaults from `DefaultOperatorConfig` (which uses
`DefaultControllerConfig`).

---

## Manager Flags And Environment

These settings are read at process start from flags and environment variables.
They are not part of the operator ConfigMap.

| Flag / Env | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--config-namespace` | `bobrapet-system` | Namespace containing the operator ConfigMap. |
| `--config-name` | `bobrapet-operator-config` | Name of the operator ConfigMap. |
| `--metrics-bind-address` | `0` | Metrics endpoint bind address. `0` disables the metrics service. |
| `--metrics-secure` | `true` | Serve metrics over HTTPS with authn/authz when enabled. |
| `--metrics-cert-path` | empty | Directory containing metrics server TLS certs. |
| `--metrics-cert-name` | `tls.crt` | Metrics server TLS certificate filename. |
| `--metrics-cert-key` | `tls.key` | Metrics server TLS key filename. |
| `--webhook-cert-path` | empty | Directory containing webhook TLS certs. |
| `--webhook-cert-name` | `tls.crt` | Webhook TLS certificate filename. |
| `--webhook-cert-key` | `tls.key` | Webhook TLS key filename. |
| `--health-probe-bind-address` | `:8081` | Liveness/readiness probe bind address. |
| `--leader-elect` | `false` | Enable leader election for the controller manager. |
| `--leader-election-id` | `d3a8b358.bubustack.io` | Leader election ID to prevent clashes. |
| `--leader-election-namespace` | empty | Namespace for leader election resources. Defaults to the in-cluster namespace and fails out of cluster if unset. |
| `--enable-http2` | `false` | Enable HTTP/2 for metrics and webhook servers. |
| `--tracing-init-timeout` | `10s` | Timeout for OTLP tracer initialization. |
| `--tracing-shutdown-timeout` | `5s` | Timeout for OTLP tracer shutdown. |
| `ENABLE_WEBHOOKS` | `true` | When set to `false`, disables admission webhooks. |

---

## Reload behavior

The operator watches its ConfigMap and applies updates at runtime. Settings
that only affect controller wiring (for example, worker counts, rate limiter
options) and templating evaluator construction are captured at startup and
require a restart to take effect. Other values that are resolved during
reconcile may update live.

---

## Scheduling Controls

`spec.policy.queue` assigns StoryRuns to a scheduling queue. Queue names must be
DNS-1123 labels and are lowercased at runtime.

`spec.policy.priority` defines ordering within the queue. Higher values run
first. Ordering is strict within the queue and enforced without preemption.
Priority aging can be enabled per queue to prevent starvation.

| Key | Default | Purpose | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `storyrun.global-concurrency` | `0` | Caps total running StepRuns across all queues. | Provides a safety valve for cluster load. |
| `storyrun.queue.<name>.concurrency` | `0` | Caps running StepRuns within a queue. | Prevents one workload class from starving others. |
| `storyrun.queue.<name>.default-priority` | `0` | Priority used when `spec.policy.priority` is unset. | Keeps ordering deterministic without forcing per-story config. |
| `storyrun.queue.<name>.priority-aging-seconds` | `60` | Adds effective priority based on queued time. | Prevents starvation under strict priority ordering. |

**Note:** `debug.enable-metrics` controls metric emission in the operator. The metrics *endpoint* is controlled by the manager flags (`--metrics-bind-address`, `--metrics-secure`) in `bobrapet/cmd/main.go`.

### OpenTelemetry export

The operator exports traces using the OTLP gRPC exporter. Configure the exporter
via standard OTEL environment variables (set on the controller manager pod):

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (e.g., `otel-collector:4317`)
- `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` (`otlp` or `none`)
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (overrides default service name)
- `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` (additional resource tags)

Example:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=otel-collector.observability:4317
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=bobrapet-operator
```
